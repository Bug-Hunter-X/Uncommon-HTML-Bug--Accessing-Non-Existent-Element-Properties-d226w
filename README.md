This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to accessing element properties before the elements are fully loaded into the DOM.  The bug involves trying to manipulate an element's style or content before it exists in the document. The solution shows how to properly handle this by checking if the element exists before attempting any manipulation or using event listeners to ensure elements are loaded.
